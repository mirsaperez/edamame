            <p>
                1. Rehydrate your dried peppers in a large bowl of hot water 
                for about 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. While your peppers are rehydrating, roast your onions and 
                garlic in the oven under the broiler and start shredding your 
                oyster mushrooms. You can do this simultaneously, so that by the 
                time you’re done shredding your mushrooms, the peppers are rehydrated,
                and the onions & garlic are beautifully charred. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Once the mushrooms are shredded, season it with apple cider vinegar,
                 a bit of oil, garlic powder, and some salt. Give it a good massage to 
                 ensure all the pieces are coated. Cover it and let it marinate in the 
                 refrigerator while you prepare the sauce and slow-cook it, about an hour. 
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Once you’ve got the mushrooms marinating in the fridge, time to prepare
                the consommé! In a high speed blender, add the rehydrated peppers, onion,
                garlic, 1 cup broth, cloves, peppercorn, cinnamon, cumin seeds dried oregano, 
                allspice, and 2 tablespoons oil. Blend until completely smooth, about 1 minute. 
                Transfer the consommé to a saucepan on medium heat with the rest of the broth
                and bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, cover, reduce heat
                to low and simmer for an hour.  After about 20-30 minutes, make sure to give 
                it a taste and adjust seasonings.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. After the consommé has been simmering for an hour, it’s time to cook your
                ‘meat’! While the sauce is still simmering, add a bit of oil to a large
                skillet on medium high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add
                marinated mushrooms in an even layer and cook until the edges begin to
                crisp up a bit, about 13-15 minutes. Once the mushrooms are crisped 
                around the edges, add about 1.5 – 2 cups of the sauce and cook, stirring 
                often, another 5 minutes or so.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Now it’s time to make the tacos! In another pan on medium heat, add a 
                bit more oil. Dip your corn tortilla into the sauce and place onto the 
                pan – repeat with as many tortillas as will comfortably fit into the pan.
                Add your cheese and a a couple tablespoons of the mushroom ‘meat’ onto 
                one side of the tortilla. Cook until the bottom of the tortilla is lightly
                browned and crispy, about 1-2 minutes. Fold tacos in half, gently pressing 
                with a spatula. Repeat the process with oil, sauce, tortillas, and remaining 
                meat.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Serve tacos hot with onions, cilantro, fresh lime wedges, and 
                additional sauce for dipping or sipping!
            </p>

            <h1>Slow-Roasted Leg of Lamb</h1>
            <p>
                1.Place the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary leaves and mint
                in a food processor and blitz until well blended. Cover the meat with
                the marinade, working it in to the flesh well, and leave the lamb to
                marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.Pre-heat the oven to 160°C/140°C Fan/Gas Mark 3. Put the marinated
                lamb in to the roaster and season with salt and pepper. Cover the
                roaster with foil and place into the oven to roast for 3 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.Remove from the oven and take off the foil. Cut the garlic heads in
                half, horizontally, to expose the cloves. Arrange the garlic around
                the meat and spoon some of the meat juices over. Roast, uncovered, for
                another 2 hours until the meat is tender. Scatter the apricots in the
                roaster around the meat and heat through.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.Fry the limes on a Toughened Non-Stick grill and then place in the
                roaster. Scatter pomegranate seeds over the meat and serve with
                hummus, cucumber with yoghurt, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh
                radishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                5.In a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice. Process for
                1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom down, then process for 30
                seconds more. Add the chickpeas and blitz, then add boiling water and
                process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and spoon into a
                mixing bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
                6.Cover with cling film and refrigerate. Just before serving, spoon
                the hummus into serving bowls with a drizzle of olive oil and a
                sprinkle of paprika on top.
            </p>
            <p>
                7.Remove the ends of the cucumber, then cut it in half lengthways and
                scrape out the seeds. Slice and place into a bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
                8.Mix the yoghurt, mint and garlic in a mixing bowl and season with
                salt and pepper. Spoon the yoghurt over the sliced cucumber and mix
                well.
            </p>
            <p>
                9.Make your hummus the day before serving; the taste will be better
